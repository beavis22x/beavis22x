Unfortunately, while i working on all my previous projects I unknowingly set a fictional email in 
the local git config settings. And here's what github says
about it:
"Generic email addresses--such as jane@computer.local--cannot be added to GitHub 
accounts. If you use such an email for your commits, the commits will not be linked 
to your GitHub profile and will not show up in your contributions graph."

And it's very sad because I tried to make meaningful 
commits and it was problematic invent names for them.
